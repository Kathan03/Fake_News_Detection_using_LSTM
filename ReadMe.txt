Fake News Detection System Using LSTM

The aim of this project is to classify the legitmacy of news text. This can be achieved by understannding the sequential dependency of words present in the text. The achived classification accuracy is 99.69%. Additionaly, I have also reduced the number of trainable parameters my 78.57%, with increasing the classification accuracy by 2%.

LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, and it's a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs in capturing and learning long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Traditional RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it difficult for them to learn from and remember information over long sequences. LSTM networks address this issue by introducing a more complex structure, including memory cells and various gating mechanisms.
